# Hi there!

My name is Nander Carmo and I am a young Brazilian with a passion for programming and engineering! I am graduated as a Mechatronics technician at CEFET-MG and I am currently studying Electrical Engineering with focus on Computer Engineering at UFMG, where I was part of two teams of science communication and innovation: [EITA!](https://eitaufmg.wixsite.com/eita) and [SDF](http://demonstracoes.fisica.ufmg.br/).

In my free time I like to play and watch football (‚öΩÔ∏è), I am also in love with Ultimate Frisbee and I am proudly part of an amateur team [√ìvnis de Prata](https://www.instagram.com/ovnisdeprata/) (ü•è), reading books (üìö) and of course, all these things are better when done with music (üéµ)!
